        <div id="about-section">
            <p>My name is Ashley Waldner. I live in Mauston Wisconsin. I am a student in UW Madisons Coding Bootcamp. I have been interested in the way that websites and apps are created since I was in High School, and I am looking forward turning my hobby into a career.</p>

               <p>I love the process of building something from nothing and even more than that I love being able to solve problems. I also enjoy learning new things, lucky for me coding provides me with the opportunity to continually learn and to solve problems! I love to learn but I also love to share the things that I learn because whatâ€™s the point of knowing something if you are just going to keep it to yourself?</p>
                
               <p>Outside of coding, I love music. One of my favorite thing is to learn how to play new musical instruments, and teach others how to play them as well. Another one of my favorite things to do is to serve at my church in any area that I am needed specifically on the worship, tech and kids teams.</p>
