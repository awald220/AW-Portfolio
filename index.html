                <p>My name is Ashley, and I am located in the Mauston, WI area.  I am currently a student with University of Wisconsin’s Extended Campus-Coding Bootcamp. I have been interested in designing and coding applications for years, and I am looking forward to turning my hobby into career.</p>
                <p>I love the process of creating something from nothing, and even more than that I love being able to solve problems. I enjoy being able to continuously learn new things and expand my skill set. I am flexible and want to work with my customers to get the website that they desire.</p>
                <p>I have experience with a variety of computer languages and related libraries such as the following: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and Node. I enjoy working with API’s and Firebase as well. I believe in putting in the hard work to build quality projects that my customers want.</p>
